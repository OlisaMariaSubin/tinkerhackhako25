# Diagrams
User Interface (Frontend)

Mobile/Web App (UI): This is the interface where users interact with the app, inputting text and selecting desired response styles (e.g., casual, formal, sarcastic).
Frontend Framework: This could be a framework like React (for web) or Flutter (for mobile) to handle dynamic content updates based on user inputs.
API Layer

API Gateway: Acts as a middleware to manage communication between the frontend and backend. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Text Input Handling: Takes input from users, like text messages or prompts, and passes it on to the backend.
Backend

User Authentication & Authorization: Ensures secure access, handles login, user profiles, and preferences.
AI Text Generation Service: The core service that interacts with the GPT model (or similar AI) to generate personalized text responses based on context and user preferences.
Tone/Context Analysis: This component analyzes the tone, context, and specific instructions (e.g., casual, formal) to adapt responses accordingly.
AI Engine

GPT-3/4 or Custom AI Model: The AI model that processes input and generates the responses.
Training & Fine-Tuning: This process helps refine the AI to adapt to different writing styles and improve over time.
Database

User Data Storage: Stores user preferences, profile settings, and interaction history.
Response History: Keeps track of previous responses to improve personalization.
Notification/Alert System

Notifies users of updates or when they receive a new suggestion or feature within the app.
Admin Panel

For managing users, reviewing performance data, and adjusting model parameters as needed.
